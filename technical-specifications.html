        <h1>Technical Specifications</h1>

        <h2>Technical Info OceanBridge Unit</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voltage:</strong> 12/24V DC (Max 32V DC)</li>
            <li><strong>Power Consumption:</strong> 6W (500mA @ 12V DC), NMEA2000 Bus Powered LEN = 10</li>
            <li><strong>Operating temperature:</strong> -10°C to 50°C ambient</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Network / Interface Connections</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NMEA 2000 connection (N2k compatible connector):</strong> supports Navico group only (Simrad, Lowrance, and B&G products)</li>
            <li><strong>Ethernet connection (IP67 RJ45 connector)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Power Input</h2>
        <p>It utilise the same NMEA 2000 connector but with optional 2m power cable provided by OceanLED.</p>

        <h2>Wi-Fi Capability (2.4 GHz)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Access Point (AP) Mode:</strong> Users can connect their devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops) directly to the OceanBridge Wi-Fi network to access its features and functionalities.</li>
            <li><strong>Client Mode:</strong> Users can configure the OceanBridge to connect to their preferred Wi-Fi network, enabling the device to access the internet and communicate with other devices on that network (smartphones, tablets, or laptops).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
        <p><strong>Bluetooth Audio Connection:</strong> The OceanBridge device can establish a wireless connection with Bluetooth-enabled audio devices (such as phone, tablet), allowing for the transmission of audio signals.</p>

        <h2>DMX / RDM (RS485 Interface)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 x DMX512-A input (Binder 5-way 720 series connector)</li>
            <li>1 x DMX512-A input / output (Binder 5-way 720 series connector)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Correct control cable to connect to the lights available from OceanLED.</p>

        <h2>Audio Line</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 x Audio In 3.5mm stereo connector (46cm/18” long flying lead)</li>
            <li>1 x Audio Out 3.5mm stereo connector (46cm/18” long flying lead)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Allow passthrough (audio in, to audio out) and also audio out if unit is connected to Bluetooth audio.</p>

        <h2>External Switch Inputs</h2>
        <p>10 way connector. Supports up to four external switch inputs (momentary push to make type), with LED drive feedback (e.g., switches with internally illuminated LEDs). These switches can be connected to the OceanBridge device to control various functionalities, such as selecting scenes or controlling the lights.</p>
        <p>Optional 1m connection cable available from OceanLED.</p>

        <h2>USB Connectivity</h2>
        <p>1 x USB port for connecting a USB drive which allows firmware updates and save user settings.</p>

        <h2>On-board Test / Reset Switch</h2>
        <p>Perform two functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow users to test the system and observe the behaviour of connected lights or fixtures.</li>
            <li>Enables users to perform a complete reset, erasing all settings and configurations stored in the device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Indicator LEDs</h2>
        <p>System status, indicate faults, network activity.</p>

        <h2>On-board Sensors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gyroscope/Accelerometer Sensor:</strong> enables the OceanBridge device to detect and respond to the movement of the vessel. Based on the vessel's motion, the lighting effects can be adjusted or changed to enhance the visual experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal Sensor:</strong> The OceanBridge device is equipped with a thermal sensor that allows for monitoring the temperature of the printed circuit board (PCB) within the bridge unit. This sensor helps in maintaining optimal operating conditions and monitoring potential overheating issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Physical Specifications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 210mm x 91mm x 65mm (8.3” x 3.6” x 2.6”)</li>
            <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> IP66 robust polycarbonate</li>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 490g</li>
        </ul>
